            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO ALL TRUE POORE CLARES.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> JOHN in his Apocalypse saw of old a woman, that was newly brought to bedd, and who was mightily persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Dragon that sought to devoure the fruict of her wombe, but two wings was given unto her like those of an Eagle, to flye into the desert (her proper place) to save her fruict, and to putt her selfe into securitie. True poore Clares, you, who like legitimate children, sigh after the spiritt of your holy Mother, nor ever cease to bring forth new resolutions to live according to the perfection of your Holy Rule. That mysterious woman was a figure and embleme of you, for our Saviour in his Gospell, compares you to women in childbirth by reason of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34309:3"/> great paines and labours which the Devill that true infernall Dragon, and much more desirous to stifle and devour your little ones, then ever Pharao did to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate male-children of the Hebrews, makes you suffer in the execution of your holy designes: thus S. Clare your well beloved Mother in her holy Rule, and your dear Foundresse Marie Gouge of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memorie in these her pious directions have not left you in this distresse, but given two wings, as it were, of little Eagles, to assist you to avoide this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, viz: mortification and devotion, which may carry you to a holy denuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and disengagement from your selves and all created things, which is, as it were a spirituall desert, and bring you all to God, the true place where the greatest Eagles build their nests, that is, soules advanc't in Vertue; they shew you with the fingers of their holy lives and celestiall instructions, that sinn ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remou'd you from God, you must return to him again with the Spouse in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34309:3"/> the canticles by the mountaine of myrrh and hill of incense, that is in practising mortification, and exercising your selves in devotion; tis your dutie to incline the interiour ears of your hearts to the sweet and gracious summons of Patronesses so holy and so zealous of good; tis your duty to make stepps in the interiour of your soules up towards this holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hill, by which they desire to make you return again to your first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; this is their marke and butt, this is the end which they propos'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they aym'd to lead you to God, by the way of mortification and devotion. Accept then of this pious Collection, and make use, of them to the greater glorie of God and the spirituall good of your own soules; which shall be the dayly wishes of your unworthy Father in Christ.</p>

               <head>Directions how to say the Divine Office with due devotion and attention.</head>
               <p>WHat care we ought to have in saying the divine Office accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34309:37"/> to the examples of the holy men, is witten in the 27. Chapter of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipomenon, <hi>Despise not your self, our Lord hath chosen you to stand before him and adore him.</hi> Wherfore since God hath chosen man to so high a preferment, it is very requisit we should know how, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner humble service doth consist. The holy man Gerson affirmeth that in saying your Mattins and other hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, carefully and studiously, leasurely and distinctly, consisteth the greatest exercise of a Religious man, and is so fit for him as nothing more. S. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict doth call this the worke of our Lord, especially because it is the chiefest office that any man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form gratefull to the divine Majesty. S. Jerome doth affirm that to offer up Hymns, Psalmes, and spirituall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and to shed teares for our own offences, and those of our neighbour, is to reconcile the people to God, and to pacify our Lord with his flock:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34309:37"/> all which things are to be accomplis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in the divine office. Wherfore we ought very diligently to apply our whole study, and inward powers to the due execution thereof: least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that dreadfull sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Prophet Jeremy c. 48. v. 10. fall upon us, <hi>Maledictus qui facit opus Domini fraudulenter.</hi> Accursed be he who do's our lords worke negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</p>

            <div type="directions">
               <head>Three sorts of preparation for saying the Divine Offices.</head>
               <p>THe first of living well, which is to be exercised in doing all pious works, to restrain our selves from all vanities, and daily to keep our hearts free and pure from all things that may in the least sort soyle them, alwaies directing our thoughts and works whatsoever unto Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God and his honour.</p>
               <p>The 2. is, that before we begin
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34309:38"/> the Divine Office, we be carefull to recollect our spirits, excluding all forrain thoughts, or whatsoever may give us distraction in our Divine Office, considering serioussy what wee are going about. It behoveth us also diligently to weigh these things following.</p>
               <p>That we come
<list>
                     <item>To worship God.</item>
                     <item>To thank God.</item>
                     <item>To intreate God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First we come to <hi>worship God</hi> in three persons and one essence with the worship of <hi>Latria</hi> which is due to God alone, for the benefit of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that is the Incarnation of his only son, our B. Saviour his life, death, Resurrection, and Ascension; which Mysteries we ought carefully to consider, and ponder with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and reverence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We come to <hi>thank God</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him for the great benefits which we have received and do momentarily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34309:38"/> receive, and hope to receive hereafter. Therfore it is requisit that we behold an renew the same every houre and moment of our life: but especially when we are so particularly employed in a worke that hath so great relation and adherence thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We go to <hi>intreat God,</hi> in besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his most immeasurable clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for our own necessities and those of the whole Church: but to bring all these particulars with more facility to our mind it will assist us much, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively to think that nothing is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re necessary or profitable for us then God.</p>
               <p>The 3. Preparation is a zealous prayer, which we must make to the end we may worthily finish the task of our devotions, and in imitation of the three Kings offer to his divine goodnes the <hi>gold</hi> of devotion, the <hi>frankincense</hi> of attention, and the <hi>Myrrhe</hi> of constant perseverance.</p>
               <p>Being to begin the Office you may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34309:39"/> say. I adore thee O Christ, and bless thee O Lord, for by thy Cross and Passion thou hast redeemed the world. Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee; To thee be praise. To thee be glory. To thee be thƒÅks giving forever. May all creatures worthily worship thee; praise, glorify, and adore the most high and undivided Trinity, and the humanity of my blessed Lord Jesus, who in time past was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with men upon earth, and now sits at the right hand of his Eternall Father: I beseech the Holy Virgin with the holy Angels and Saints, and those whose feasts are celebrated this day throughout the whole Church, that they will all help me with their aid and furtherance, to the end I may finish this my office worthily to the true praise of Almighty God, and the profit of my soule.

               <p>THose who desire to increase and go forward in a spirituall life,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34309:44"/> let them go that certain way, which is the interiour and mutuall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with Almighty God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this holy Exercise. Because in Prayer vertues are received, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and augmented. <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the holy Apostle S. James saith, <hi>availeth much,</hi> ascendeth to heaven before the tribunall seat of Almighty God, and bringeth unto men every good and perfect gift; causeth such a league and union betwixt God and them, as it maketh their soules apt to receive in-infinite grace from his divine Majesty. Daniel by Prayer converted the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceness of Lions into the meekness of Lambs. Prayer made the fire loose its force, being not able to burn the three children in the midst of the flaming furnace. Prayer likewise stayed the course and altered the uniform mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavens, giving power to the voyce of man to stop and detain the sun for as many howers as was necessary for the obtaining the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34309:44"/> against his enemies. Jacob through the vertue and efficacy of Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against the Angell. Yea Prayer tyed the hands and infinit power, (if we may so say) of the Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: for by the Prayer of Moyses Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God seemed to be as it were disabled to chastize the people, when he said unto this faithfull servant of his. <hi>Suffer me that my fury may be angry against them:</hi> as if he should have said: <hi>Detain me not with thy Prayers.</hi> Prayer finally obtaineth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for whatsoever offences: the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican getteth remission of his sins, and the Prodigall child pardon, and returns again into favour by Prayer. Therfore it being so profitable and necessary for a spirituall life, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the vertue thereof whatsoever it will in heaven or Earth? it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit that all Religious persons, spend as much time as their state and leisure will permit them in this kind of Prayer: which rather consisteth in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34309:45"/> the actions of the will then the long discourse or speculation of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, sensible gifts, or consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for that is not in our own hands. The fruit of Prayer is, that we raise from the same, <hi>humility, patience, obedience, indifference &amp;c.</hi> This is alwaies in our power, (the grace of God presupposed.) To the end that Prayer be performed with Recollection and attention, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that we do not take it in hand as a thing of small moment, not ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hly, but advisedly; not with a slow and dull heart, but with a lively at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and undaunted courage: for otherwise we may incurre the curse of the Prophet Jeremy, who saith, <hi>Cursed is he that doth the worke of our Lord negligently.</hi> Neither is so great attention and force to be used as therby to weary and break our heads, and hinder our health: for so, insteed of pleasant and sweet milk we should <hi>wring forth blood,</hi> (as the wisdom
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34309:45"/> of God signifieth in Proverbs) cause a feare and horrour to undertake this holy Exercise. wherfore to avoid these extreams, Moderation is to be used in such sort, as by over much striving therein we hurt not our selves, as was aforesaid, nor through too much carelesness let our mind be carried away with unprofitable matters. Let not wandring thoughts trouble you, but put them away sweetly: for you merit more by patient resistance then in having great comfort and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Humble and accuse your self in the sight of God, that you cannot be so long in his presence without so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earthly cogitations: beseeching our B. Lady, your holy Angel, and all others with the Saints to pray for you and supply your wants in due praise and love of his divine Majesty. For scruples and temptations, which happen in Prayer, the first remedy, is not to hearken, or give eare unto them.</p>

Ruminate the matter divers times before you meditate, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your self to tast and feel those good motions and affections, which you think the matter will yield you to draw forth. For if in an affaire of importance which we handle with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly creatures, we seriously think and consider thereof before: how much more ought we to do it in this so spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall an Exercise and the greatest which can possibly be undertaken, being we are therein to treat with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God about the good and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our soule.</p>
                  <p>The 3. condition, is the Presence of God, Coming to the place where you purpose to meditate consider the presence of Almighty God comparing

Or consider your self a beggar, sick, and guilty, to crave of your benefactour an almes, of your Physitian health, and of your Judge pardon; beseeching your good Angel, and some of your Patrons to accompany and assist you therein.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="2">2. The 2. if the matter be Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, is to represent unto your self the place and persons present. As for example: Meditating some Mystery of Christ, put before your eyes some mountain, citty, or desert, fitting the place to the Mistery or sentence, which you are to consider. If what you purpose to meditate be spirituall matter, void of such similitude, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the 2. Preamble according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34309:48"/> If of Hell: think of the length, breadth, and depth of that horrid pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, with all things that may give hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto man. If of Heaven: repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the specious pleasantness of that Celestial Country. If on death: your self lying on your death bed, or laid in your grave. If on Judgement: our sweet Saviour sitting on his Judgment seat. If on sin: your soule to be held prisoner in your body, fettered with chaines of disordered passions, and clogged with the burden of the flesh. But if the sentence of your Meditation be such, as cannot make these nor the former similitudes: call to mind who spoke or did it, in what manner, sort, or with what intention: reciting that sentence two or three times unto your self: which manner you must also accustome in all sorts of Meditations, expecting what it shall please God to teach you: therfore saying: <hi>Speak Lord thy servant heareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The 3. Preamble, or petition is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34309:48"/> briefly to crave light and knowledge of the Mystery you meditate on, and grace to stirr up in your self such particular good affections of this or that vertue as you shall see the matter is most apt to minister occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for your spirituall profit.</p>

                  <head>The <hi>3.</hi> Condition of mentall Prayer, is Meditation, which consisteth in the three powers of the soule.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. FIrst: let the memory remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to call to mind the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Almighty God, before whom you are to chuse the matter whereon you are to meditate, in what manner you are to do it, and wherfore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly: the Understanding must discourse of the matter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it be of some person, as of our Saviour: some words of holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, some actions, as of the Passion of CHRIST JESUS, or the suffering of his Saints: the verity, cause, properties,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34309:49"/> effects, conveniences, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as, WHO, WHAT, WHY, WHERE, WHEN, BY WHAT MEANS: And this is not to be done slightly, but very seriously, so as they may move the will, pondering and as it were shewing them again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly: the will must stirr up in it self these affections, and make such good purposes as the subject doth require, and the understanding hath before approved for good: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to perform towards God: 1. The affections of praise of his holy name. 2. Love of his goodness. 3. Confidence in his mercy. 4. Faith in his verity. 5. Feare of his justice. 6. Gratitude for his benefits. Towards your self, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of love or hatred, desire or disdain, joy or sorrow, conversion, or aversion feare or hope, dislike or pursuit of the matter which you have discovered: and in these of the will you must incite and stay your self in every point of your meditation.</p>

                     <p>FIrst the memory is to present the matter unto the understanding, as is above said, and that is to consider the persons, actions, and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as is set down: and when by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and particular view of the matter, you shall sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any speciall point to move af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: as to discover Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, love, or any benefit, done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us by him, example of vertue, or difformity of vice, then stay that discourse, and seek to stirr up such good affections, as the matter will most aptly afford. As for example; when by discourse you have found the goodness of God, or some great benefit of him to us; then stay, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, view, and admire him for the greatnes thereof: inciting your self to have a perpetuall memory and ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgment
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34309:50"/> of them, drawing somthing for your instruction and encouragement to his most perfect service and your own progress in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. This is a great part of the fruit, which you are to reap of Meditation, the which you must perfect by collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and Prayer.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Helps, if the will do's not yield unto those affections which you desire.</head>
                     <p>REflect with your self what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions such considerations ought to move in you towards God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se love, goodnes, and benefits you see to be so great, and you have deserved so little: the which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought to produce in you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great love, praise, gratitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, obedience, confidence &amp;c. Then come to your will again, and see whether it will yield to those affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If it do not, then labour to move it either by such persuasions as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34309:50"/> you would give to another, whom you desire to incite to the same affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Or else, reprove your dulness; or ask your self the question <hi>why you should not yeld thereunto:</hi> seeing that you can remember your self and others to be exceedingly moved unto such affections towards creatures for less motives. And again say. <hi>Why should not I feel the like to my Creator, or at least yeld with my will to desire it, and purpose the same?</hi> Then have recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to Prayer and say. O my God, I will purpose &amp;c. I desire you to assist me with your grace: confessing your misery and unworthines, beseeching him to be your help. And somtimes say those words of Jacob: <hi>I will not leave thee O Lord untill thou givest me thy blessing:</hi> or those of the Cananean woman. <hi>Yes Lord I am a dog, yet doggs eate, the crums which fall from their Maisters table:</hi> or other such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. And thus, having at least by some meanes or other stirred up the foresaid
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34309:51"/> affections, though not so fervently as we desire, persever in exercising the will, drawing forth somthing for your profit. This example, in due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may serve to teach you how to proceed upon any other matter: as when you have by discourse discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any vertue or vice in some <hi>word, deed</hi> or <hi>thought,</hi> or some person who is presented in the Meditation: first by staying or pondering, or someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes admiring how worthy a thing that vertue is, in that person, and how foule the vice: the fruit and the losse and shame of the other. Then proced as you will to move and stirr up the affection you seek; never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting your self with generall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be they never so fervent, nor spend to much time in them, but make some particular resolutions, of which you stand in most need for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement and correction of your life, which having stirred up, confirmed, and resolved to practice, conclude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34309:51"/> the part, and much of the whole Meditation with devout colloquies or speaches of heart unto Almighty God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe first is to give God thanks for the holy affections, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and purposes, which he hath inspired into you, as also for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and mercy which you have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the discourse of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34309:52"/> by his holy grace you made in your Meditation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly by Petition or Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, which you demand of God, and earnestly conjure him, as it were through the death and Passion of our sweet Saviour; the merits of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Virgin Mary, the intercession of your good Angel, and all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saints to bless your affections and resolutions, which to his honour and glory you have made, to the end you may faithfully put them in execution, and for making your self more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his grace, crave pardon for your sins and offences committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his divine Majesty, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of some vice and augmentation of some vertue, offering your self wholy unto his holy service with a firme purpose to avoid whatsoever may offend him.</p>

                  <head>The <hi>5.</hi> Condition of Mentall Prayer is Recollection.</head>
                  <p>FIrst, your Meditation being ended, it is very profitable to ponder well and consider how it succeeded; whether you followed the method that was taught, in the preparation, Preamble, Meditation and all the rest, and what point moved you most, and how you have exercised your self therein, craving pardon for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and giving Almighty God thanks for what was well, resolving to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what you see to be profitable unto you, and avoid the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You must have a particular care to conforme your self unto those good motions, which Almighty God shall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34309:53"/> give you in Prayer: for, so to do, is a most speciall means to obtain the increase of grace: for the contrary would be an ingratitude and contempt of Gods graces, which deserveth not to have the like hereafter: a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall help for the same is to have care to remember them: and for that end it is good at Mass, and the Divine Office to renew and offer them to Almighty God, and divers times in the day to do the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly and lastly, if at any time it happen that through ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, want of due Preparation, or yielding to temptation, your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation doth not succed; be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed or discouraged, but humbling your self in Gods sight, acknowledge your imperfections and negligences, crave pardon of his divine Majesty, purposing by his holy grace to be more carefull and diligent the next time: for the obtaining of which, have confidence in his divine goodnes,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34309:53"/> and thank him that he hath vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to permitt you the favour to be so long in his presence. And if it were to have the least good affection in all the time of your meditation, or but a remembrance of Almighty God, think not the time lost, and labour fruitless, but rather if you wil make use of that little you have by often remembring it, doubt not but that little spark by laying wood to it, and often blowing the coales will turn to a great fire of the love of God.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34309:54"/> you used not that diligence you ought either in meditation, or in preparing your self, by foreseeing what you are to meditate on, according as hath been said, whereof it cometh, that you do it with negligence, &amp; dryly: and Almyghty God in punishment thereof doth worthily deprive you of the consolation and tast of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The remedy to rid your self of this punishment, is to take away the cause. At other times this aridity cometh without fault; and we must not therfore leave Meditation: for as a time of consolation doth please you, when our Lord like the sun in the spring cometh neare ro you, and mak's you have gust in meditation: so you must not be displeased or leave your Exercise, when the self same saviour as the sun in winter doth go from you, which he also doth for your good, that you may plant roots of humility, exercise patience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, knowing that when he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34309:54"/> goeth from you, you remain dry without devotion, having confidence that God will accept of your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and endeavours, and send you consolation when he thinketh most fitting; and persevering with courage and hope, remember the words of Tobias. <hi>Qui post tempestatem, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillum facit. Who after a storme mak's a calme.</hi> As also that of Job. If <hi>we have received good things, why should not we beare with the bad.</hi> It may be also that Almighty God suffereth you to be dry in Prayer, to try with what intention you come to so holy an Exercise: proving whether you be his souldier for payment, expecting he should reward you with gust and devotion: or else to make you know that your tast and comfort in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is his gift, which he bestoweth on whom, and when he will, that by this means you dispose your self to ask humbly of him, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence expect what you aske. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34309:55"/> you pray to please God therby as you ought to do; you may say: I did not begin my meditation to feel gust or devotion, but for the love of God, my sweet saviour JESUS, &amp; for his love I will continue it.</p>
                  <p>Another difficulty is, that the divell will represent Meditation unto you, as very hard and difficult, so to make you differr it, and afterwards wholy forsake it. But if you have a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to do a thing acceptable to your Creatour, either Meditation will not seem so tedious or you will hold all well employed for is love. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courtiers do you see going a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times a yeare unto the Princes chamber without hopes of once spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto him, onely to be seen by him, that he may take notice how they endeavour to shew their duty unto him: so must you come to the Exercises of Prayer, which is as it were Gods Chamber of Presence purely and meerly to do your duty and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34309:55"/> your fidelity. And if it please him not to speak to you, no otherwise then if he saw you not, or if you were not in his presence, you must not for all that go away discontented, or discomforted, but continue still with patience and a devout behaviour in the presence of his soverain good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and without doubt your service will be acceptable to him, and at last he will take notice of your constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diligence.</p>

                  <head>CAUSES OF DISTRACTIONS.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. First from the Divell who doth still endeavour to hinder us from the fruit of Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It proceedeth from our own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which is free, untamed, and ill governed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From some affections unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34309:57"/> which draw our thoughts after them, for <hi>where the treasure is, there is the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. From cares which sting, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the heart into a thousand parts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From coldnes in enforcing our selves to this so noble an Exercise.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From ignorance, not knowing how to discourse or meditate, or sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che into hidden verities, and ponder them in such sort as may move the will and stirr up affections of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This ignorance by the grace of God will be remedied by this form, and method following.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div type="directions">
               <head>The meanes to resist distractions of heart and tediousnes of spirit, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally foure</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrst, profound humility, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our weakness and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; being ashamed to stand before God with such distractions, accusing our selves of our offences both past and present.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34309:57"/>2. The second, fortitude of mind, resolving not to admit any distraction, although it administer matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or seem of much importance; for nothing behoveth us so much as to tend to Prayer and to God, before whom we are. Wherfore if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times we should be diverted, we must turn again as many times more, without loosing courage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third remedy, Prayer it self: beseeching our saviour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect our thoughts and wandring affections, that wee may use at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and devotion: craving the help and intercession of his glorious Mother with the holy Angels and Saints, who are willing to assist all those that pray: saying somtimes with David. <hi>My heart hath forsoken me, may it please you Lord to deliver me from the violence which I suffer, and have respect to help.</hi> Other times with the Prophet: <hi>My soule is as earth wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout water.</hi> Again: with the blind
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34309:58"/> man in the Ghospell. <hi>O son of David have mercy on me.</hi> Or with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. <hi>Depart from me o yee malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and I will search the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is Confidence in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: persuading our selves, that being he commandeth us to pray, he will give us grace wherby we may resist the divell, bridle our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, restrain our passions, moderate our cares, cast from us our coldness: But with this confidence wee must adjoyne diligence, as Cassian saith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving before Prayer whatsoever you think may distract you therein: imitating in this the subtility of our adversary; who as S. Nilus Abbot saith, <hi>ordaineth all his temptations, wherwith he tempteth spirituall persons, to hinder them from Prayer &amp; the fruit thereof: tempting them with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to disquiet them, curiosity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them, multitude of busines to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe them, pride and ingratitude to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34309:58"/> make them barren and dry &amp;c.</hi> By this we may learn to be no less provident and carefull of our good than the divell is of our harm, ever governing our selves in such sort as may most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Prayer, remembring the words of our sweet saviour in S. Luke. <hi>It behoveth us alwaies to pray, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be weary.</hi>
